          chatbot every day at 19:00, the homework deadline is 18:00 the next
          day. In most cases, the lesson + performance of homework will take up
          to 2 hours of your time (however, remember that everything is
          individual).

        question_title: W﻿hy do we need the tag learning chatbot?
        description: >-
          It's like your training for a marathon, you will use these tags
          throughout the marathon and it is very good if you have time to learn
          them before the start 👍 


          It's okay if you don't have time, you will catch everything during the marathon.
